    $ cd reaction
    $ npm install -g yarn
    $ yarn install
    $ cp .env.oss .env

## Instructions

-   Development of components happen in [storybooks](https://getstorybook.io):

          $ yarn start
          $ open http://localhost:9001/

-   Run the tests:

          $ yarn test

-   Run the tests continuously (or use `vscode-jest`):

          $ yarn test -- --watch

-   In vscode, run the `TypeScript: Run type-checker` task and open the `PROBLEMS` view to see continuous type-checker
    results.

-   After updating components, be sure to deploy a new demo (sharing is caring!):

          $ yarn deploy-storybook

-   When using new changes in metaphysicsâ€™ schema, be sure to update the local schema copy:

          $ yarn sync-schema


-   There are some suggested VSCode extensions in `.vscode/extensions.json` and additional docs at [docs/vscode.md](docs/vscode.md).

## Commits and Deployments

Circle CI is set up to publish releases to NPM automatically via [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) following every successful merge to master.

Release versions (major, minor, patch) are triggered [by commit messages](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#commit-message-format), when they adhere to [Ember conventions](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/blob/master/packages/conventional-changelog-ember/readme.md):

```
[TAG context] commit message
```

[Valid tags](https://github.com/artsy/reaction/blob/master/package.json#L175) for release include PATCH, DOC, FIX (patch), FEATURE (minor), and BREAKING (major). Commits that do not adhere to this convention will not trigger an NPM release.

##### Example Patch Release
```
[FIX onboarding] Modal does not open
[PATCH] Bump version
```

##### Example Minor (Feature) Release
```
[FEATURE auctions] Add relay-based slider component
```

##### Example Major (Breaking) Release
```
[BREAKING publishing] Replace children with props for caption editing
```
